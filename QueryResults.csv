<p>My select box is the following.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Select id=""mySelect"" size=""9""&gt; &lt;/Select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: The following code was helpful with chaining. However, (in Internet&nbsp;Explorer) <code>.val('whatever')</code> did not select the option that was added. (I did use the same 'value' in both <code>.append</code> and <code>.val</code>.)</p>

<pre><code>$('#mySelect').find('option').remove().end()
.append('&lt;option value=""whatever""&gt;text&lt;/option&gt;').val('whatever');
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: Trying to get it to mimic this code, I use the following code whenever the page/form is reset. This select box is populated by a set of radio buttons. <code>.focus()</code> was closer, but the option did not appear selected like it does with <code>.selected= ""true""</code>. Nothing is wrong with my existing code - I am just trying to learn jQuery.</p>

<pre><code>var mySelect = document.getElementById('mySelect');
mySelect.options.length = 0;
mySelect.options[0] = new Option (""Foo (only choice)"", ""Foo"");
mySelect.options[0].selected=""true"";

<p>I have created a new virtualenv with</p>

<pre><code>source bin/activate

<p>I got some output that seems to indicate that the installation is fine</p>

<p>How do I select one row per id and only the greatest rev?<br>
With the above data, the result should contain two rows: <code>[1, 3, ...]</code> and <code>[2, 1, ..]</code>. I'm using <strong><em>MySQL</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Currently I use checks in the <code>while</code> loop to detect and over-write old revs from the resultset. But is this the only method to achieve the result? Isn't there a <strong>SQL</strong> solution?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong><br>
As the answers suggest, there <em>is</em> a SQL solution, and <a href=""http://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/3d74dc/1"" rel=""noreferrer"">here a sqlfiddle demo</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong><br>
I noticed after adding the above <em>sqlfiddle</em>, the rate at which the question is upvoted has surpassed the upvote rate of the answers. That has not been the intention! The fiddle is based on the answers, especially the accepted answer.</p>

<p>How can I make the text on my site scale in relation to its container? I tried using <code>em</code>, but this doesn't scale either.</p>

<p>My reasoning is that things like my menu become squished when you resize, so I need to reduce the <code>px</code> <code>font-size</code> of <code>.menuItem</code> among other elements in relation to the width of the container.

<p>I'm aware I can add breakpoints, but I really want the text to scale as <em>well</em> as having extra breakpoints, otherwise I'll end up with hundreds of breakpoints for every 100&nbsp;pixels decrease in width to control the text.</p>

<p>I'm just getting into Python and I really like the terseness of the syntax. However, is there an easier way of writing an <code>if</code>-<code>then</code>-<code>else</code> statement so it fits on one line?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>if count == N:
    count = 0
else:
    count = N + 1
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a simpler way of writing this? I mean, in Objective-C I would write this as:</p>

<pre><code>count = count == N ? 0 : count + 1;
</code></pre>

<p>Is there something similar for Python?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I know that in this instance I can use <code>count == (count + 1) % N</code>. </p>

<p>I'm asking about the general syntax.</p>

<h3>Option: Using a tuple</h3>

<p>Consider this trivial example:</p>

<pre><code>def f(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return (y0, y1, y2)
</code></pre>

<p>However, this quickly gets problematic as the number of values returned increases. What if you want to return four or five values? Sure, you could keep tupling them, but it gets easy to forget which value is where. It's also rather ugly to unpack them wherever you want to receive them.</p>

<h3>Option: Using a dictionary</h3>

<p>The next logical step seems to be to introduce some sort of 'record notation'. In Python, the obvious way to do this is by means of a <code>dict</code>.</p>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return {'y0': y0, 'y1': y1 ,'y2': y2}
</code></pre>

<p>(Just to be clear, y0, y1, and y2 are just meant as abstract identifiers. As pointed out, in practice you'd use meaningful identifiers.)</p>

<p>Now, we have a mechanism whereby we can project out a particular member of the returned object. For example,</p>

<pre><code>result['y0']
</code></pre>

<h3>Option: Using a class</h3>

<p>However, there is another option. We could instead return a specialized structure. I've framed this in the context of Python, but I'm sure it applies to other languages as well. Indeed, if you were working in C this might very well be your only option. Here goes:</p>

<pre><code>class ReturnValue:
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2

def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2)
</code></pre>

<p>In Python the previous two are perhaps very similar in terms of plumbing - after all <code>{ y0, y1, y2 }</code> just end up being entries in the internal <code>__dict__</code> of the <code>ReturnValue</code>.</p>

<p>There is one additional feature provided by Python though for tiny objects, the <code>__slots__</code> attribute. The class could be expressed as:</p>

<pre><code>class ReturnValue(object):
  __slots__ = [""y0"", ""y1"", ""y2""]
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2
</code></pre>

<p>From the <a href=""http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/pylang/__slots__.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Python Reference Manual</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>__slots__</code> declaration takes a sequence of instance variables and reserves just enough space in each instance to hold a value for each variable. Space is saved because <code>__dict__</code> is not created for each instance.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Option: Using a <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">dataclass</a> (Python 3.7+)</h3>

<p>Using Python 3.7's new dataclasses, return a class with automatically added special methods, typing and other useful tools:</p>

<pre><code>@dataclass
class Returnvalue:
    y0: int
    y1: float
    y3: int

def total_cost(x):
    y0 = x + 1
    y1 = x * 3
    y2 = y0 ** y3
    return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2)
</code></pre>

<h3>Option: Using a list</h3>

<p>Another suggestion which I'd overlooked comes from Bill the Lizard:</p>

<pre><code>def h(x):
  result = [x + 1]
  result.append(x * 3)
  result.append(y0 ** y3)
  return result
</code></pre>

<p>This is my least favorite method though. I suppose I'm tainted by exposure to Haskell, but the idea of mixed-type lists has always felt uncomfortable to me. In this particular example the list is -not- mixed type, but it conceivably could be.</p>

<p>A list used in this way really doesn't gain anything with respect to the tuple as far as I can tell. The only real difference between lists and tuples in Python is that lists are <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable"" rel=""noreferrer"">mutable</a>, whereas tuples are not.</p>

<p>I personally tend to carry over the conventions from functional programming: use lists for any number of elements of the same type, and tuples for a fixed number of elements of predetermined types.</p>

<p>After the lengthy preamble, comes the inevitable question. Which method (do you think) is best?</p>

<p>I've typically found myself going the dictionary route because it involves less set-up work. From a types perspective however, you might be better off going the class route, since that may help you avoid confusing what a dictionary represents.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are some in the Python community that feel <a href=""http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/isinstance/"" rel=""noreferrer"">implied interfaces should be preferred to explicit interfaces</a>, at which point the type of the object really isn't relevant, since you're basically relying on the convention that the same attribute will always have the same meaning.</p>

<p>So, how do -you- return multiple values in Python?</p>

<p>How do you measure the memory usage of an application or process in Linux?</p>

<p>From the blog article of <a href=""http://virtualthreads.blogspot.com/2006/02/understanding-memory-usage-on-linux.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Understanding memory usage on Linux</a>, <code>ps</code> is not an accurate tool to use for this intent.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Why <code>ps</code> is ""wrong""</strong></p>
  
  <p>Depending on how you look at it, <code>ps</code> is not reporting the real memory usage of processes. What it is really doing is showing how much real memory each process would take up <strong>if it were the only process running</strong>. Of course, a typical Linux machine has several dozen processes running at any given time, which means that the VSZ and RSS numbers reported by <code>ps</code> are almost definitely <em>wrong</em>.</p>

<p>My problem started off with me not being able to log in as root any more on my mysql install.  I was attempting to run mysql without passwords turned on... but whenever I ran the command </p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code># mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>I would never get the prompt back. I was trying to follow <a href=""http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/recover-mysql-root-password.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">these instructions to recover the password</a>.</p>

<p>The screen just looks like this: </p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>root@jj-SFF-PC:/usr/bin# mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables
120816 11:40:53 mysqld_safe Logging to syslog.
120816 11:40:53 mysqld_safe Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /var/lib/mysql
</code></pre>

<p>and I don't get a prompt to start typing the SQL commands to reset the password. </p>

<p>When I kill it by pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>, I get the following message: </p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>error: 'Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)'

Check that mysqld is running and that the socket: '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' exists!
</code></pre>

<p>If I retry the command and leave it long enough, I do get the following series of messages:</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>root@jj-SFF-PC:/run/mysqld# 120816 13:15:02 mysqld_safe Logging to syslog.

<p>But then if I try to log in as root by doing: </p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code># mysql -u root
</code></pre>

<p>I get the following error message: </p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)
</code></pre>

<p>I checked and <code>/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock</code> file doesn't not exist. The folder does, but not the file.  </p>

<p>Also, I dunno if this helps or not, but I ran <code>find / -name mysqld</code> and it came up with:</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>/var/run/mysqld - folder
/usr/sbin/mysqld - file
/run/mysqld - folder
</code></pre>

<p>I'm new to Linux and MySQL, so I don't know if this is normal or not. But I'm including this info just in case it helps.</p>

<p><strong>I finally decided to uninstall and reinstall mysql.</strong></p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>apt-get remove mysql-server
apt-get remove mysql-client
apt-get remove mysql-common
apt-get remove phpmyadmin
</code></pre>

<p>After reinstalling all packages again in the same order as above, during the phpmyadmin install, I got the same error:        </p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)
</code></pre>

<p>So I tried again to uninstall/reinstall. This time, after I uninstalled the packages, I also manually renamed all mysql files and directories to <code>mysql.bad</code> in their respective locations.</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>/var/lib/mysql

<p>Then I tried to reinstall <code>mysql-server</code> and <code>mysql-client</code> again.  But I've noticed that it doesn't prompt me for a password.  Isn't it supposed to ask for an admin password? </p>

<pre><code>git push --force
</code></pre>

<p>would force my local copy to push changes to the remote one and make it the same. <strong>It does force the update</strong>, but when I go back to the remote repo and make a commit, I notice that the files contain outdated changes (ones that the main remote repo previously had).</p>

<p>As I mentioned in the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5509543/how-do-i-properly-force-a-git-push#comment6275726_5509588"">comments to one of the answers</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[I] tried forcing, but when going back to master server to save the changes, i get outdated staging. Thus, when i commit the repositories are not the same. And when i try to use git push again, i get the same error.</p>

<p>How can I fix this issue?</p>

After a quick research I found <a href=""http://java.sun.com/docs/hotspot/gc5.0/ergo5.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ergonomics in the 5.0 Java Virtual Machine</a> and others saying on Windows machine the JVM defaults max heap size as <code>64MB</code>.</p>

<p>I could increase the <strong>max heap size</strong> using <strong>command line</strong> option to java, but that would require figuring out available RAM and writing some launching program or script. Besides, increasing to some <strong>finite</strong> max does not <strong>ultimately</strong> get rid of the issue.</p>

<p>I could rewrite some of my code to persist objects to file system frequently (using database is the same thing) to free up the memory. It could work, but it's probably a lot work too.</p>

<p>One way I was thinking is running a for/while loop through the string, check for a digit, extract all the digits after that and then look to see if there was a leading '-', if there is, multiply the int by -1.</p>

<p>What's a Windows command line statement(s) I can use to get the current datetime in a format that I can put into a filename?</p>

<p>I want to have a .bat file that zips up a directory into an archive with the current date and time as part of the name, for example, <code>Code_2008-10-14_2257.zip</code>. Is there any easy way I can do this, independent of the regional settings of the machine?</p>

<p>I don't really mind about the date format, ideally it'd be yyyy-mm-dd, but anything simple is fine.</p>

<p>So far I've got this, which on my machine gives me <code>Tue_10_14_2008_230050_91</code>:</p>

<pre><code>rem Get the datetime in a format that can go in a filename.
set _my_datetime=%date%_%time%
set _my_datetime=%_my_datetime: =_%
set _my_datetime=%_my_datetime::=%
set _my_datetime=%_my_datetime:/=_%
set _my_datetime=%_my_datetime:.=_%

rem Now use the timestamp by in a new ZIP file name.
""d:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe"" a -r Code_%_my_datetime%.zip Code
</code></pre>

<p>I can live with this, but it seems a bit clunky. Ideally it'd be briefer and have the format mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>I'm using Windows Server 2003 and Windows&nbsp;XP Professional. I don't want to install additional utilities to achieve this (although I realise there are some that will do nice date formatting).</p>

<p>I could not find documentation anywhere showing all the valid string formats while calling <code>new Date()</code> function.</p>

<p>This is for converting a string to a date. If we look at the opposite side, that is, converting a date object to a string, until now I was under the impression that JavaScript doesn't have a built-in API to format a date object into a string.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Today, I played with the <code>toString()</code> method on the date object and surprisingly it serves the purpose of formatting date to strings.</p>

<pre><code>var d1 = new Date();
d1.toString('yyyy-MM-dd');       //Returns ""2009-06-29"" in Internet Explorer, but not Firefox or Chrome
d1.toString('dddd, MMMM ,yyyy')  //Returns ""Monday, June 29,2009"" in Internet Explorer, but not Firefox or Chrome

<p>My version of node is always v0.6.1-pre even after I install brew node and NVM install v0.6.19.</p>

<p>My node version is:</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>node -v
v0.6.1-pre
</code></pre>

<p>NVM says this (after I install a version of node for the first time in one bash terminal):</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>nvm ls
v0.6.19
current:    v0.6.19
</code></pre>

<p>But when I restart bash, this is what I see:</p>

<p>So where is this phantom node 0.6.1-pre version and how can I get rid of it? I'm trying to install libraries via NPM so that I can work on a project.</p>

<p>I tried using BREW to update before NVM, using ""brew update"" and ""brew install node"". 
I've tried deleting the ""node"" directory in my /usr/local/include and the ""node"" and ""node_modules"" in my ""/usr/local/lib"".
I've tried uninstalling npm and reinstalling it following <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/268946/uninstall-node-js"">these</a> instructions.</p>

<p>All of this because I was trying to update an older version of node to install the ""zipstream"" library. Now there's folders in my users directory, and the node version STILL isn't up to date, even though NVM says it's using 0.6.19.</p>

This is the standard method of rounding most people expect in most situations.</p>

<p>I also would like only significant digits to be displayed - i.e. there should not be any trailing zeroes.</p>

<p>I know one method of doing this is to use the <code>String.format</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912385);
</code></pre>

<p>returns:</p>

<pre><code>0.91239

<p>which is great, however it always displays numbers with 5 decimal places even if they are not significant: </p>

<pre><code>String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912300);
</code></pre>

<p>returns:</p>

<pre><code>0.91230

<p>Another method is to use the <code>DecimalFormatter</code>:</p>

df.format(0.912385);
</code></pre>

<p>returns:</p>

<pre><code>0.91238

<p>However as you can see this uses half-even rounding. That is it will round down if the previous digit is even. What I'd like is this:</p>

<p>The problem is that the error is not always reproducible; it sometimes works with some pages, and sometimes, it barfs by throwing a <code>UnicodeEncodeError</code>. I have tried just about everything I can think of, and yet I have not found anything that works consistently without throwing some kind of Unicode-related error.</p>

<p>One of the sections of code that is causing problems is shown below:</p>

<pre><code>agent_telno = agent.find('div', 'agent_contact_number')
agent_telno = '' if agent_telno is None else agent_telno.contents[0]
p.agent_info = str(agent_contact + ' ' + agent_telno).strip()
</code></pre>

<p>Here is a stack trace produced on SOME strings when the snippet above is run:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""foobar.py"", line 792, in &lt;module&gt;
    p.agent_info = str(agent_contact + ' ' + agent_telno).strip()
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xa0' in position 20: ordinal not in range(128)
</code></pre>

<p>I suspect that this is because some pages (or more specifically, pages from some of the sites) may be encoded, whilst others may be unencoded. All the sites are based in the UK and provide data meant for UK consumption - so there are no issues relating to internalization or dealing with text written in anything other than English.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas as to how to solve this so that I can CONSISTENTLY fix this problem?</p>

<p>The header section is fixed height, but the header content may change.</p>

<p>I would like the content of the header to be vertically aligned to the bottom of the header section, so the last line of text ""sticks"" to the bottom of the header section.</p>

<p>So if there is only one line of text, it would be like:</p>

<pre><code>-----------------------------
| Header title
|
|
|
| header content (resulting in one line)
-----------------------------

<p>And if there were three lines:</p>

<pre><code>-----------------------------
| Header title
|
| header content (which is so
| much stuff that it perfectly
| spans over three lines)

<pre><code>#
# This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See &lt;URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2&gt; for detailed information.
# In particular, see 
# &lt;URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/directives.html&gt;
# for a discussion of each configuration directive.
#
# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
# what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
# consult the online docs. You have been warned.  
#
# Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
# of the server's control files begin with ""/"" (or ""drive:/"" for Win32), the
# server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin
# with ""/"", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so ""logs/foo.log""
# with ServerRoot set to ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2"" will be interpreted by the
# server as ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2/logs/foo.log"".
#
# NOTE: Where filenames are specified, you must use forward slashes
# instead of backslashes (e.g., ""c:/apache"" instead of ""c:\apache"").
# If a drive letter is omitted, the drive on which httpd.exe is located
# will be used by default.  It is recommended that you always supply
# an explicit drive letter in absolute paths to avoid confusion.

#
# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
# configuration, error, and log files are kept.
#
# Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point
# ServerRoot at a non-local disk, be sure to point the LockFile directive
# at a local disk.  If you wish to share the same ServerRoot for multiple
# httpd daemons, you will need to change at least LockFile and PidFile.
#
ServerRoot ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2""

#
# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
# ports, instead of the default. See also the &lt;VirtualHost&gt;
# directive.
#
# Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to 
# prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.

<p>Unlike many other programming languages, which are often picked up on the go from tutorials found on the Internet, few are able to quickly pick up C++ without studying a well-written C++ book. It is way too big and complex for doing this. In fact, it is so big and complex, that <strong><em>there are very many very bad C++ books</em></strong> out there. And we are not talking about bad style, but things like sporting <em>glaringly obvious factual errors</em> and <em>promoting abysmally bad programming styles</em>.</p>

<p>Please edit the accepted answer to provide <strong>quality books</strong> and an approximate skill level — <em>preferably</em> <strong>after</strong> <em>discussing your addition in <a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/10/loungec"">the C++ chat room</a></em>. (The regulars might mercilessly undo your work if they disagree with a recommendation.) Add a short blurb/description about each book that you have personally read/benefited from. Feel free to debate quality, headings, etc. Books that meet the criteria will be added to the list.

<p>I would also like it so there aren't any extra characters, or parameters in the URL.</p>

<p>How can I achieve this?</p>

<hr>

<p>Based on the answers posted so far, I am currently doing this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form method=""get"" action=""/page2""&gt;
    &lt;button type=""submit""&gt;Continue&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>but the problem with this is that in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_%28web_browser%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Safari</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer"" rel=""noreferrer"">Internet&nbsp;Explorer</a>, it adds a question mark character to the end of the URL. I need to find a solution that doesn't add any characters to the end of the URL.</p>

<p>There are two other solutions to do this: Using JavaScript or styling a link to look like a button.</p>

<p>Using JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button onclick=""window.location.href='/page2'""&gt;Continue&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But this obviously requires JavaScript, and for that reason it is less accessible to screen readers. The point of a link is to go to another page. So trying to make a button act like a link is the wrong solution. My suggestion is that you should use a link and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/710089/how-do-i-make-an-html-link-look-like-a-button"">style it to look like a button</a>.</p>
